# Marine-Robot

# Description 

This intelligent Actuator is designed to controll the two thrusters of the robot.
the board will communicate with the on board computer of the robot via the CAN bus.
**the features of the board are :** 
-STM32F103C8T6 ARM 32-bit Cortexâ„¢-M3 is the CPU of the board. Higher frequency, higher speed and cost-effictive.
-2 channels high power H-bridge .
-SN65HVD230 CAN bus controller Operating with a single 3.3 V Supply and Compatible With ISO 11898-2 Standard.
-Serial wire debuger as a programming interface and uart as serial communication interface.
-Operating Voltage up to 24V.
-Maximum Motor Current: 10A continuous, 30 A peak.
-Buck regulator to produce 3.3V/1A output with reverse voltage protection.
-LEDs for motor output state.
-PWM frequency up to 20 kHz.
**Here are the schematic and the board:**
